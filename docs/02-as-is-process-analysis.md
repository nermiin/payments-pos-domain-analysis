## Failure Scenarios (Current)

| Scenario | Current Behavior | Customer/Merchant Impact |
|----------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Auth timeout | Terminal shows decline; auth may succeed | Double attempt risk |
| Offline mode | Store-and-forward — no central visibility | Delayed settlement surprises |
| Partial capture | Not supported — full void/re-auth | Hotel/pre-auth use cases broken |
| Refund | Only via acquirer portal — 2–3 days | CS calls, poor NPS |

## To-Be Summary

Single gateway API with idempotency keys, unified merchant dashboard, and explicit auth/capture/refund state machine.

See [Pain Points](07-pain-points.md) for prioritized gaps.
